# Credit_Cartd-_Fraud_Detection
Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent credit card transactions using machine learning. The initiative addresses the challenges of digital fraud in the era of online transactions, aiming to mitigate financial losses and enhance trust in financial systems.

Objectives
Develop robust and accurate predictive models for real-time fraud detection.
Employ advanced machine learning techniques to identify patterns indicative of fraudulent behavior.
Provide actionable insights through a user-friendly web application for financial institutions and merchants.
Key Features
Machine Learning Models: Utilized Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, SVM, Random Forest, and others.
Web Interface: A Flask-based application that integrates the GBM model for real-time fraud detection.
Data Insights: Visual analytics on fraud distribution by gender, age, country, bank, etc.
Real-Time Predictions: Immediate feedback on transaction statusâ€”Fraud or Not Fraud.
Scalable Solution: Designed to handle large volumes of transactional data efficiently.
Dataset
The dataset was sourced from Kaggle: Credit Card Fraud Transaction Data. It includes features such as transaction amount, merchant category, type of card, and more.

Preprocessing Steps
Data Cleaning: Removed unnecessary columns and handled null values.
Data Standardization: Ensured consistency in date formats and numeric values.
Outlier Detection: Addressed outliers using the Interquartile Range (IQR) method.
Encoding: Converted categorical data to numerical format using One-Hot Encoding and Label Encoding.
Normalization: Scaled numeric features to a uniform range using Min-Max Scaling.
